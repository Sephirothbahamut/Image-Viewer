# Image-Viewer

A simple and lightweight replacement for the classic Windows Photo Viewer, with dark background and no overlay or thick UI borders/elements. The entire window is exclusively dedicated to viewed images.

Controls:

- Mouse scroll wheel: Zoom-unzoom.
- Keyboard left-right, mouse button 3-4: Next-previous.
- Keyboard 1-0: Loads image at the specified index (see later).
- Mouse drag: moves the image around the window.
- Keyboard F5: Reload the current image.

Notes:

- Opening the program with an image as parameter, will add all the images in the current folder to the list iterated over with next-previous.
- Opening the program with multiple images as parameters, will add only those images to the list iterated over with next-previous.
- Loading or reloading an image scales it to fit the current window size.
